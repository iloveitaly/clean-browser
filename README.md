# Clean Workspace: Archive Web Browser Tabs

I've been expirementing with how to make my mornings more productive. One glitch I've found in my mind is I can easily
get distracted by open tabs on my browser, especially if I'm trying to write or read something which I want to give
my full attention to. I've found that if I close all my tabs, I can focus better on the task at hand. However, I don't
want to lose any interesting tabs so I never actually do that.

This is simple utility to automate this process. It will close all your tabs, and send them to todoist (and output)
them to the terminal.

We'll see if this actually helps!

## Usage

* Add your todoist token to `.envrc`
* Customize the url blacklist
